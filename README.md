# Hi, IÂ´m Markus ðŸ‘¨ 

<img src="https://data-mastery.com/img/logo.3e0fa417.png" width="250px">

I am a data scientist who enjoys working on connecting the worlds of data science and web development. In my daily job I mostly work with R and Python and in my spare time I like to work with JS, especially Vue.JS. I also have a website where I host my private projects. I use a remote server from Digitalocean and deploy my applications with Docker. <br>I also love to inspire other people for technology and have therefore created a course on udemy.com and run my own YouTube channel since September 2020
