# Hi, IÂ´m Markus ðŸ‘¨

I am a data scientist who enjoys working on connecting the worlds of data science and web development. In my daily job I mostly work with R and Python and in my spare time I like to work with JS, especially Vue.JS. I also have a website where I host my private projects. I use a remote server from Digitalocean and deploy my applications with Docker.
